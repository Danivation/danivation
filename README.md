# Hi, I'm Daniel,
a programmer and robotics enthusiast.

## About Me
I have been the programmer for V5RC team 5069Y for both the 24-25 High Stakes season and the current 25-26 Push Back season. Outside of competitive robotics, I enjoy engineering projects and coding for fun. I like traveling, and I especially like aviation and airplanes.

## Experience

I am experienced in many different programming languages, including C/C++, Python, HTML/JS/CSS, React, and some others.

## Robotics
This is my second year as part of team 5069Y, as well as the second year the team has existed. Last year, our team of all freshmen qualified for the world championships in Dallas after placing 2nd overall at the Nebraska state championships.
